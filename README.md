# spotify_music_recommender

## Introduction
Spotify Music Recommender is an app that allows you to log in via your Spotify account, see your top tracks and get a (play)list of recommended songs that best suit your liking.

The recommendation algorithm will use machine learning and a csv file loaded with music (TBA).
In the future there might also appear a little section with analysis of your music taste, most listened to artists, genres etc., as I am fond of data analysis.

## To run:
